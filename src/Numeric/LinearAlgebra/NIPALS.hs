-- | Calculate the first principal component of a set of samples.

-- or 'leftSV'

-- Example:
--
-- > let (pc,scores,residuals) = firstPC $ fromRows samples

-- Each row in the matrix is one sample. Note that this is transposed
-- compared to the implementation of principal components using 'svd'

-- The second argument is a starting guess for the score vector. If
-- this is close to the actual score vector, then this will cause the

-- | Calculate the first principal component -- calculating the
-- samples fresh on every pass.
--
-- This function calculates the exact same results as
-- 'firstPCFromScores' (minus the residual), but instead of an input
-- 'Matrix', it takes a monad action that yields the list of samples,
-- and it guarantees that the list returned by the action will be
-- consumed in a single pass. However the action may be demanded many
-- times.
--
-- The residual can't be calculated lazily, like it is in
-- 'firstPCFromScores', because the samples would need to be
-- demanded. Instead, to calculate the residual use 'residual'.
--
-- There is no corresponding @firstPCM@ that guesses the initial score
-- vector for you because if you need to use this function instead of
-- 'firstPC', then you really should come up with a reasonable
-- starting point or it will take forever.
